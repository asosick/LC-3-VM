### Overview
A quick implementation of a LC-3 VM for macOS

Followed https://www.jmeiners.com/lc3-vm/ as a tutorial

LC-3 ISA https://www.jmeiners.com/lc3-vm/supplies/lc3-isa.pdf

### Notes
This isn't exhastively tested but it runs hello world and 2048 just fine :)

### Future
Going to work on compiling the actual asm to obj files soon so I can write new programs

## 2048 running on the terminal
